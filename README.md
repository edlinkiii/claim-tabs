# Claim Tabs JS Web Component
Claim Tabs is going to be used in a live production claims-tracking system. They're more like shortcuts to recently accessed claims than "tabs" (but that's what they are currently called). If a claim is accessed a tab is created for it. Clicking the tab will link to (and display) that claim. Clicking the "x" will remove the tab.

Demo code is running to add a batch of claims, and then simulate adding more (one at a time).
